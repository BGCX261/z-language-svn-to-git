Overview
========

Currently there is not much to see here. The basic development framework is there:

- ANTLR is used to build Java files from the grammar definition file src/z/grammar/Z.g.
- The generated Java parser builds an AST from the input using Scala types defined in
  src/z/AST.scala
- The main program is written scala (src/z/Main.scala)
- Currently, the language spec is the simple expression evaluator from The Definitive
  ANTLR Reference, and the "compiler" just spits out the AST.


Installation
============

Prerequisites:

Install JDK (> 1.5.0)
Install ANT (> 1.7.0)
Install Scala (> 1.7.1 final)

ANTLR v3 is included in the distribution. You can also get it from www.antlr.org.

ANT_HOME and SCALA_HOME should be defined.

Copy lib/antlr3.jar to your ANTLR library directory (for example, ~/.ant./lib)

Compiling:

> ant (generate the parser, compile it, compile the scala code)
> ant s (just recompile the scala code)

Running:

> run.bat (windows)

or

> ./run.sh (unix)
