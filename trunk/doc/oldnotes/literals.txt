* Integer literals consist of:

- optional prefix determining the base of the following number
- number denoting the value of the literal
- optional postfix that determines the type of the literal:

Normally, the type of an integer literal the smallest signed integer type
that can hold the constant.

  typeof(12345) == int16;
  typeof(-12345) == int16;

The following prefixes are allowed:

0x - base 16
0d - base 10 (the default)
0o - base 8
0b - base 2

The following postfixes can be used to force the type (i: signed integer,
u: unsigned integer)

  i8
  i16
  i32
  i64
  u8
  u16
  u32
  u64

If the value of the literal is larger than the specified type but can be fit
into the same number of bits, the value is taken as the raw representation of
the value.

  0xffi8 == -1;

* Boolean literals: true and false. (Type: bool)

* Character literals consist of a character surrounded by single quotes. The
  character can  be specified by:

Inserting it literally:

  'a';

Escaping a character with a special meaning. Allowed escape characters are:

	audible alert (bell) BEL  \a   7
	backspace            BS   \b   8
	horizontal tab       HT   \t   9
	newline              LF   \n  10
	vertical tab         VT   \v  11
	formfeed             FF   \f  12
	carriage return      CR   \r  13
	backslash            \    \\  92

  '\n';

Using integer literals preceded by a backslash:

  '\123';	 // '{'
  '\0x1234';     // Same as 'U1234'
  '\0d92';       // backslash
  '\0o40';       // ' '
  '\0b10010101';

Type of a character literal is char.

* String literals consist of sequences of character literals, without the single 
  quotes but surrounded with double quotes instead. Two adjacent string literals
  are concatenated into one.

  "Hello world!";
  "Katakana example: \x30A1";
  "Occasionally you need to break a string literal into two, like this: "
  "0x123""4 - it is followed by a number or one of [abcdef] in case "
  
Type of string literals is string.
