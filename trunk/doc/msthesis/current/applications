Better safety at runtime:

-Type-checked printf
 -Macros

Just better:
-Automatic logging
-Automatic printing of values (for example,
 print an object of type struct { int x; String y; })

(Perhaps automatic profiling?)

-Aspect-oriented programming
 -Is this what Yegge talked about 'advice' systems?
