The goal is to construct a minimal, simple and clean subset of C and
then introduce a compile-time metaprogramming facility. The objective is
to preserve as much as possible of the spirit of C. In particular, the
syntax of the language is changed only if not doing so would needlessly
complicate the implementation.
