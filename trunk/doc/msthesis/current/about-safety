About safety properties of metaprogramming languages
====================================================

Obviously you shouldn't be able to, say, delete files from within a
metaprogram. But it seems that in general, when [Tradeoffs in
metaprogramming] safety issues in metaprogramming are considered, the
wrong issues are addressed. Having the meta-language "safe" for instance
in the sense of being able to guarantee that every program halts is akin
to the old anecdote about wearing life vest on and but removing it when
embarking to sea, except that the analogy is appropriate [1].

[1] the original talked about enabling safety checks on in debug builds and
removing then in release builds
