Are there any other benefits of this idiom? Yes indeed. Sometimes you have an
assignment and you need some logic on the right hand side. How do you write:

var proven = {
    var n = Math.round(100*Math.random());
    var total = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        total = total + (2*i) + 1
    }
    return total == ((n + 1) * (n+1));
};
alert(proven);


You can't, of course. There are two problems with trying to use braces in this
case. First, Javascript only allows braces to form code blocks in conjunction
with specific keywords like if and function. Second, Javascript code blocks are
not expressions--they do not produce values. This is why languages like
Javascript need an if statement and a ternary operator: if blocks produced
values, you would only need if expressions.
