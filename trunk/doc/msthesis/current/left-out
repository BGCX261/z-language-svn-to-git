Don't even try to touch:

-modules (even though they can be mentioned in passing)

-generics (although they might warrant a mention as well, such as
 Type T = list(int); // call a metafunction)

-optimization (generate straightforward and stupid code, but make the
 language so that optimizers can be easily written)

-exceptions
